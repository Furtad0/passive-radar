This application is not currently in a working state.  It requires UHD to run.

It is based off of rx_multi_samples, from the UHD examples folder.  However, while rx_multi_samples consistently runs without error, this application crashes with a UHD timeout error.

Since take_samples_rapid.cpp, off of which this application also draws from, has been significantly improved since development began, it might be advisable to start from scratch rather than attempting to debug this application.
