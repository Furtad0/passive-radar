# passive-radar/GRC

applications: C++ applications that may be compiled and run on a USRP device.  These use UHD.

flowgraphs: GNURadio Companion flowgraphs.  I have not yet gotten Network Mode working with the USRP E312, and it doesn't have most utility, so most of these operate on .dat files.

modules: C++ custom modules for GNURadio Companion.

samples: A folder for storing .tar archives and .dat files recorded on the USRP.  .gitignored.

scripts: Some bash scripts for automating the data collection process.  These are functional when copied to the ~/grc/scripts directory of the USRP.
