applications: C++ applications that may be compiled and run on a USRP device.  These use UHD.  The backbone of this project.

flowgraphs: GNURadio Companion flowgraphs.  These are primarily useful for demonstration (e.g. demodulating FM broadcasts).

modules: C++ custom modules for GNURadio Companion.  This is currently a development dead end.

scripts: Some bash scripts for automating the data collection process.  These are functional when copied to the ~/grc/scripts directory of the USRP.
