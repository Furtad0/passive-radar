Utility scripts for automating sample-taking.

Each script's function is described in its help message.  To view this, run
```
$ script_name.sh --help
```

Currently in-use versions of scripts are in this directory.  Older versions are in old/ and a set of scripts to take a full-spectrum measurement is in full_spectrum/.

test_FM.sh is a slightly special case.  This script should work wherever it is placed; its output is a .wav file in the home directory.
